        <h2>Our Experience</h2>
        <p>The City of Mishawaka's municipally owned sewage works is working to make a nearly 60-year-old wastewater treatment facility meet federal guidelines of the Clean Water Act.  Umbaugh analyzed various cost scenarios as the utility negotiated with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Justice and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) to find a workable solution.</p>

      <p>Governmental units are constantly seeking new, better and more cost-effective solutions to the demand for energy and other services.

        <h2>Our Services for Utilities</h2>
        <p>If only it were as simple as turning on a faucet and letting an endless supply of resources flow to customers. But your job as the utility owner gets more difficult every day. Constantly increasing quality standards, new federal mandates and regulatory compliance are just the beginning. When times are good, you must plan ahead to serve more customers to support economic development.  But when customers are closing their doors, you must reduce operations and budgets &#8211; and balance good service with rates your customers can afford.</p>
