        		        <p>"Business as it used to run in the counties can no longer happen," says Ken Paust, county commissioner in Wayne County, Indiana.</p>
                  <p>He's speaking of how local governments in Indiana were affected when property tax caps began taking effect just as a general economic downturn reduced other revenue sources.</p>
