                	<h2>Our Experience</h2>
					<p>Decatur County, Indiana, had the opportunity of a lifetime in 2006. All they had to do was present the winning case for why their area was the most advantageous location for a new Honda Motors automobile assembly plant. And like most economic development projects, responding quickly was essential to stay in the running.</p>

					<p>Quick deadlines? We're used to them at UMBAUGH. In the world of economic development, quickly having the right response makes the difference between securing economic development for your area and watching it go elsewhere.</p>
					<p>With most local governments' tax revenues decreasing, economic development is the key to growing your tax base. But it's not wise to say yes to every economic development opportunity that comes your way. You need to run the numbers, consider alternatives and make informed decisions about what's right for your community to avoid overburdening your existing taxpayers or putting your investment at risk. UMBAUGH helps communities evaluate and structure economic development packages to produce long-term financial gain - not pain, using tax increment financing, tax abatement and the right balance of a variety of economic development tools.</p>
					<p>UMBAUGH's economic development services continue long after the deal is done. We provide accurate financial data and reporting so you can make informed decisions about releasing tax revenue and leveraging your investment to generate additional development.</p>

At the same time, you have this gnawing fear about giving away too much. UMBAUGH can help you make good decisions with:</p>

                    </ul>

					<p>Bond Issuance - You don't issue bonds every day, and you've got to get it right. The stakes are too high to risk a mistake or miss an opportunity to save. Since UMBAUGH is an independent advisor, our only priority is doing what's best for the local governments we represent.  We can provide:</p>
					<ul class="left">
                        <li>Official Statements and Bond Sale Preparations</li>
                        <li>Presentations to Bond Ratings Agencies</li>

					<p>Post Issuance - Unfortunately, paperwork does not go away after the bonds are sold. You as the bond issuer have a great deal of responsibility for monitoring your TIF revenue, reporting and compliance, at a time when you'd much rather celebrate the benefits of your hard-won economic development project.

					<ul class="left">
