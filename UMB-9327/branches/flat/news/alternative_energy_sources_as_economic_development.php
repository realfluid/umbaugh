						<p>Wind farms are a relatively new form of economic development with unique financial considerations for both private and public entities. For private land owners, lease terms and liability protection are important factors to consider. For public entities, other aspects rise to the top of the priority list.</p>
						<p>Every project is unique. When deciding whether to pursue wind farms in your community, your top priorities should be protecting the infrastructure (both now and in the future), creating economic development agreements to create "win-win" scenarios, and ensuring open communication -- both internally as well as to the public.</p>
						<p>If you are considering wind turbines for your area, the tax abatement, tax base and tax rate implications will be essential elements. There are significant tax breaks associated with wind farms in Michigan. These projects are subject to Industrial Facility Tax, but may be partially exempt from some taxing authorities such as school districts. Investment in wind farm technology is primarily considered to be personal property. It is therefore necessary to work closely with company representatives and Michigan Economic Development Corporation for appropriate treatment.</p>
						<p>Because the construction of wind turbines requires extensive use of road and bridges, infrastructure protection is an important consideration.  A road use agreement is critical to protect the municipality's infrastructure and define liability and traffic flow during construction. Key components of a road use agreement include a detailed map of roads, bridges and intersections to be used for construction and a process to determine existing conditions and identify county-regulated drains that may be affected.</p>
						<p>The municipality will need to reach an economic development agreement with the wind farm developer. Wind farms may take significant acreage and therefore reduce or eliminate opportunities for other economic development to occur within the project area. You will want to be compensated for this to generate funds to promote, encourage and create other types of economic development in other areas of the county.  The amount and timing of these payments need to be negotiated and defined.  Payments should not be considered payments in lieu of taxes or any type of "property tax;" they should be treated as miscellaneous revenue or for a specific use.  Your agreement may allocate these payments to schools, libraries, towns, fire departments or other units.</p>
						<p>You will also need to have a decommissioning plan in place prior to construction to protect the county and its constituents. The plan should include provisions and details for removal of towers, footings and access roads and returning the area to as near the same condition as possible if the wind generation project is terminated. Financial assurances need to be covered, and you should establish a schedule to review the decommissioning plan periodically.</p>
						<p>While alternative energy, and specifically wind farm development, seems to be gaining momentum; there are certainly very important financial aspects to consider for your community.  If Umbaugh's experience in working through these issues would be helpful in your community, or if you have questions, please contact us.</p>
