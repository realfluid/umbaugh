                        <p>The State Budget Agency announced in early August that local income tax distributions are down for 2011 by an average of 16% statewide.  With so many people unemployed or underemployed the income tax decrease is not entirely unexpected, but it is still unwelcome news.  It signals that economic recovery is still inconsistent, and these new reduced income tax numbers also will have a negative effect on local governments as they prepare 2011 budgets.</p>
                        <p>The first action you should take is to base your budget projections for 2011 on lower income tax revenues â€“ and that's probably in addition to other income reductions you've already experienced in 2010.  You should be receiving your 2011 income tax certifications from the State in the very near future.</p>
                        <p>The second, but not so obvious, action step is to plan for circuit breaker credits to be much higher if you're in a county that uses income taxes for property tax relief, including County Adjusted Gross Income Tax (CAGIT) and the new Local Option Income Taxes (LOIT).  When sweeping property tax reform legislation was enacted in the 2008 session of the Indiana General Assembly, the same bill allowed localities to quickly reconsider or restructure LOITs as a way to make up for lost revenue or to provide dollar-for-dollar property tax relief.
							If you depend on LOIT revenue to provide property tax relief, and those collections are down, it will alter the result you were anticipating.  Any circuit breaker estimates you have been using may no longer be reliable due to this larger than expected reduction in income tax revenues.  This means that fewer property tax dollars will be available for public services in 2011. A reduction in local income tax collections may result in a reduction in property tax collections as well.</p>
                        <p>Finally, if you have issued bonds, you will need to compare the new income tax reductions to your upcoming bond payments to determine if you will receive enough revenue to make those payments.  If you expect a shortfall and you have a property tax backup, that property tax levy will need to be advertised and included in your 2011 budget.</p>
                        <p>If you need assistance with projecting revenues and forecasting budgets in light of the reduced local income tax distributions, please contact us.</p>
