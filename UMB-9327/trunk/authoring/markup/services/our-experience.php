				<p>How do you describe in a list of services all the steps it takes to assemble an economic development package just right for your community? How do you briefly explain what it takes to start with just the need for a new school building and get it financed and built? You can't. Every project is different.</p>
                <p>You can, however, learn from the experiences of others. In the Umbaugh case studies below see how we helped:</p>
				<ul>
                    <li>save more than $141 million for one school district's taxpayers,</li>
                    <li>identify $2 million a year in annual efficiencies for one group of municipal utilities,</li>
                    <li>secure the right economic development arrangements to lure a Honda plant,</li>
                    <li>finance an entire series of library renovations, and </li>
                    <li>improve the financial outlook for countless units of local government.</li>
				</ul>

						<p>Decatur County, Indiana, had the opportunity of a lifetime in 2006.
