Our Experience

How do you describe in a list of services all the steps it takes to assemble an economic development package just right for your community? How do you briefly explain what it takes to start with just the need for a new school building and get it financed and built? You can't. Every project is different.  

You can, however, learn from the experiences of others. In the Umbaugh case studies below see how we helped:
¥ save more than $141 million for one school district's taxpayers,
¥ identify $2 million a year in annual efficiencies for one group of municipal utilities,
¥ secure the right economic development arrangements to lure a Honda plant,
¥ finance an entire series of library renovations, and 
¥ improve the financial outlook for countless units of local government.

Winning a Honda Plant for Decatur County

Decatur County, Indiana, had the opportunity of a lifetime in 2006. All they had to do was present the winning case for why their area was the most advantageous location for a new Honda Motors automobile assembly plant. And like most economic development projects, responding quickly was essential to stay in the running.

"For me, this project was very challenging," said Jerome Buening, a Decatur County commissioner. "Decatur County had never been through anything of this magnitude. We enlisted professionals to help us, and the State was very important to the effort in funding for infrastructure."

Indiana was one of five states being considered for what became a $550 million investment and a potential of up to 2,000 jobs. All the "short list" locations were close to interstate highway and rail transportation and within supplying distance of Honda's Marysville, Ohio, location.

"Honda's main issue was trying to assemble enough pieces of property. They had looked at one site in Decatur County that wouldn't work, but we found a better area they hadn't looked at," said Buening.  

Umbaugh was a member of the professional services team helping evaluate proposed options and create just the right package to attract Honda. The eventual agreement was creative and beneficial to everyone.

"Umbaugh put the numbers together. They let us know what was and wasn't going to work, what pieces were missing, what we needed and when we needed it," said Buening. 

When Decatur County was named the winning location June 28, 2006, an Indianapolis Star reporter remarked on just how competitive the field had been: "Indiana not only prevailed over Ohio, but also Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan - fellow rustbelt holdovers desperate to prod their economies."

Buening says: "Our TIF (tax increment financing) was somewhat complicated. It's a county TIF because of the Honda location, but the City of Greensburg needed improvements in its water and wastewater systems to serve the new facility. We needed a creative TIF structure that would allow that to happen. In addition, we structured excess TIF revenue up front to help the City make those improvements.

"The people I dealt with at Umbaugh are outstanding individuals. They didn't talk over our heads. This was a complicated project to understand, and they explained things well. They are very down to earth and good people to work with. I'm very pleased that we worked with Umbaugh."

Honda, of course, brought jobs to the area along with new tax revenue, but Buening notes that Honda has become an "anchoring company" attracting other new businesses and keeping companies in Decatur County: "At least one company that was in danger of leaving to consolidate with their other location elsewhere not only stayed in Decatur County, they brought their other operations here rather than other way around."

The Honda plant opened in 2008, just before the automotive industry and the economy in general began serious financial struggles. Nonetheless, the economic development deal is still a great boost for Decatur County.   

"Honda has not been able to advance to a second shift as they thought they might, but the fact that they were able to hold the number of employees and the amount of time working steady in the current economic conditions is outstanding. The potential here is amazing for Decatur County," Buening adds.

Allen County Public Library Renovation and Expansion 

In response to growth and space needs, the Allen County Library, based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, renovated and expanded its main library and upgraded its branch libraries from 2002 to 2007. Umbaugh assisted with the $84 million bond issue to fund those projects.

When asked how often a project of this magnitude comes along, library director Jeffery R. Krull replied, "Once in my lifetime that's for sure. You plan renovations of this scale with the idea of planning for the next 25 to 30 years."  

"Umbaugh worked with us on the whole financial analysis and provided good material to discuss with the community. They made a great presentation when we made our report to the library board. Todd Samuelson of Umbaugh reported on how the project could be financed, the cost and how much it would affect taxpayers -- really bringing it to that personal level. He also worked with the library board throughout the planning to get our numbers together."

Renovations to the main library were so extensive that operations moved out of the building from 2004 to 2007. The project included remodeling five branch libraries and building six new branches.  

"We had great acceptance from the community right from the beginning. As each branch was opened, the community really welcomed them," said Krull.

"The critical thing was that we had a really good, solid, well thought out financial plan," Krull added. "The budget numbers we discussed were reliable. The financial plan provided a really great roadmap, so we didn't have to backtrack and say â€˜oops, we missed that number.'" 

Since completion of the library renovations, the Allen County Public Library has continued to work with Umbaugh. They joined with Allen County, the City of Fort Wayne and Fort Wayne Community Schools to commission a detailed study of the property tax cap issue and how it would affect income for each entity.

"The state had made projections about circuit breaker losses, but those projections were at a gross level," said Krull. "The combined group hired Umbaugh to perform a parcel-by-parcel analysis of real estate assessed values and property tax cap losses.  Now we all have very reliable target numbers about what revenue we will have to work with."

Umbaugh Advises Indianapolis Public Schools on Indiana's Largest School Construction Program

Indianapolis Public Schools embarked on a plan in 2001 to improve its school buildings in what has become the largest school construction program in the state of Indiana.  Umbaugh has advised the district throughout the process for a total of $693 million in bond issues.

When IPS commissioned a comprehensive facility study at the beginning of its Capital Improvements Program, some of its then 78 schools were approaching 100 years of age, and it had been more than 20 years since the urban district had been able to pass a major bond issue to support facility improvements.  Most of its schools lacked air conditioning, and the spaces did not support a modern education.

After intensive community consensus building, community members agreed to support an $832 million plan to improve every IPS school building over what was planned to be a decade-long program. The program was divided into phases to ease the impact on taxpayers.

Much has changed since 2001 - including the process for approving school construction projects, a nationwide economic downturn, a major statewide property reassessment, a property tax crisis in Marion County and the closing of several IPS schools. As a result, the overall schedule and scope of the Capital Improvements Program has been adjusted, and the third phase will be completed in 2014.

Colette Irwin-Knott of Umbaugh has advised the district on financing, bond issues and adjusting its financial and strategic plans to changing conditions. She also facilitated innovative bond financing packages in 2009 and 2010 using bond programs available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, commonly known as the federal stimulus program.

"What IPS accomplished with the 2009 and 2010 bond issues had never been done before.  It really was quite remarkable," said Irwin-Knott.

The Phase 3 financing saved IPS taxpayers more than $141 million in bond payments, due to low interest rates, IPS' strong credit ratings and the unique combination of bond programs.  

"Our financial team led by Umbaugh was on the leading edge to take advantage of the stimulus funding programs," said Dr. Eugene G. White, IPS superintendent.  "It is definitely good news for IPS taxpayers."

The net interest rate on the bonds sold in 2010 was 1.346 percent. "This is the lowest interest rate I've seen in my nearly 30 years of working with school bond issues," said Irwin-Knott.

Umbaugh also assisted IPS with presentations to secure the excellent bond ratings and with refinancing bonds to reduce interest rates.  In addition Umbaugh Cash Advisory Services has assisted IPS with the investment of bond proceeds.

Phases 1 and 2 of the Capital Improvements Program saved money for taxpayers as well: interest savings were $67 million in Phase 1 and $1 million a year in Phase 2.

"When Indianapolis Public Schools asked taxpayers to support the initial phases of its Capital Improvements Program we knew there would be no second chances," said White.  "With Umbaugh's help we have kept our promises to taxpayers about tax rates and budgets. Because of sound financial management and favorable interest rates, each phase of the IPS Capital Improvements Program has been a success."  

"So much of managing a project of this magnitude depends on earning the trust of all of the stakeholders -- from individual taxpayers to business leaders, bond rating companies, legislators, the Department of Local Government Finance and even the Governor's office," said Debra Kunce of Schmidt Strategies, the program manger for the IPS Capital Improvements Program.  "The financial information Umbaugh has supplied for the IPS Capital Improvements Program has been essential.  When Umbaugh provides financing and tax rate projections, people know they can rely on those numbers."  

The ultimate result of the IPS Capital Improvements Program is that learning environments are being improved for 25,000 IPS students and their teachers.  Although each school's needs are different, the IPS Capital Improvements Program is providing adequate classrooms, modern media centers, access to technology, air conditioning, comfortable and healthy air circulation, better lighting, functioning restrooms, building safety, playgrounds, lunchrooms and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The renovations are also saving energy and helping IPS reduce operating costs.
