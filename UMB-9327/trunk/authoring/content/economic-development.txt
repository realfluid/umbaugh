Economic Development

Quick deadlines? We're used to them at UMBAUGH. In the world of economic development, having the right response quickly may make the difference between securing an economic development investment for your area and watching it go elsewhere.

With most local governments' tax revenues decreasing, economic development is the key to growing your tax base. But it's not wise to say yes to every economic development opportunity that comes your way. You need to run the numbers, consider alternatives and make informed decisions about what's right for your community to avoid overburdening your existing taxpayers or putting your investment at risk. UMBAUGH helps communities evaluate and structure economic development packages to produce long-term financial gain - not pain, using tax increment financing, tax abatement and the right balance of a wide range of economic development tools.

UMBAUGH's economic development services continue long after the deal is done. We provide financial reporting and accurate financial data so you can make informed decisions about releasing tax revenue and leveraging your investment to generate additional development.

And like most economic development projects, responding quickly was essential to stay in the running.
