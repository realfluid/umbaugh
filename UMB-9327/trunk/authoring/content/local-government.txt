Local Government

Operating a local governmental unit - a city, town, county or township - always has challenges and opportunities.  Your current challenge may be finding new efficiencies, projecting changes in tax revenue, finding new revenue sources, funding buildings and improvements, or structuring the most advantageous economic development package.  Whatever your challenge is, Umbaugh has been there before and helped others in similar situations.

Our Services for Local Governments:

Financial Management - No one who works in local government would say that financial management is "simple." Your constituents never think about how time consuming your day-to-day tasks are. Umbaugh can help you with:
¥ Audit Preparation
¥ Budget Preparation Assistance
¥ CAFR Preparation
¥ Comprehensive Financial Planning
¥ Financial Reporting
¥ GASB 34 Compliance
¥ Tax Revenue Analysis and Management
¥ User Fee Development

As you look for every cost savings and efficiency, we can also provide:
¥ Consolidation Planning and Implementation
¥ Negotiating Inter-Governmental Agreements
¥ Performance Management Studies

If you are considering a new accounting system, let us relieve your nightmares and worry of system selection (What if it doesn't work? What if we lose our data?) with:
¥ Accounting Systems Consulting

Capital Planning -- Every unit of government has projects that need to be done - and equipment that needs to be upgraded or replaced. It's tempting to defer projects and delay expenses, but that could catch up to you someday with a big bill - or a service failure. We all know it's better to plan ahead. Umbaugh can help you with:
¥ Debt Management Studies
¥ Long-Range Capital Planning and Implementation
¥ Project Planning and Financial Development
¥ Developing and Evaluating Funding Alternatives
¥ Refinancing of Existing Debt
¥ Financial Presentations to Elected Officials and the Public

Bond Issuance - Bond issues are not something you do every day, and you've got to get it right. The stakes are literally too high to risk a mistake or miss an opportunity to save. Since Umbaugh is an independent advisor, our only priority is doing what's best for the local governments we represent. We can provide:
¥ Official Statements and Bond Sale Preparations
¥ Presentations to Bond Ratings Agencies
¥ Evaluation of Bond Insurance Proposals
¥ Competitive Bond Sales and Electronic Bidding Services
¥ Negotiated Bond Sales and Private Placements
¥ Coordination of Bond Closings
¥ Assistance to the Trustee bank

Post Issuance -- Unfortunately, the paperwork does not go away after the bonds are sold. You as the bond issuer have a great deal of responsibility for reporting and compliance, at a time when you'd much rather be paying attention to your bond-funded project. Umbaugh can take those worries off your plate as well with:
¥ In-Progress Construction Reports
¥ Arbitrage Rebate Calculations
¥ Continuing Disclosure Filings
¥ Post Issuance Compliance
¥ Escrow Verifications
¥ Parity Reports
