Our Services

Our comprehensive services are tailored to each client's special needs, offering guidance and assistance from inception to project completion, financial analysis and long-term planning. Because we are independent advisors, we are objective in analyzing, planning and structuring creative solutions for many types of projects.

Many of the same services and transactions needed by local governmental units themselves also apply to airports, hospitals and similar entities. Umbaugh assists city and county-owned airports and hospitals with: bond financing for capital projects, financial planning, organizational structure and establishing a maximum levy for tax support.

Government-owned hospitals in particular are seeking to use the local government's property tax revenues as a back up for bond financing in these times of rising health care costs, a sluggish economy and changes in reimbursement. These arrangements can be carefully structured to minimize risk -- especially since most local governments don't have property tax revenue to spare -- creating a win-win situation for both entities and taxpayers.
