Form: join-us\nYour name: Quinton Meece\nYour email: QMeece@gmail.com\nYour phone number: 765-729-3424\nYour message: I recently visited the Umbaugh website and I found many qualities within your company that I find desirable from an employer.  I would like to formally submit my resume in case there are any career opportunities within the company.  I graduate with my Master\'s of Accounting degree in June from Ball State University and I achieved my Bachelor\'s degree in Accounting from Hillsdale College last May.  I hope that some of the qualities and experiences in my resume are of interest to your company.

Thank you,
