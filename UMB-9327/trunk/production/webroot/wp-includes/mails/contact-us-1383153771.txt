Form: contact-us\nYour name: Marcie Stafford, Clerk-Treasurer\nYour email: mstafford@fortvilleindiana.org\nYour phone number: 3174854044\nYour organization: Town of Fortville\nAccounting services: on\nFinancial management: on\nYour message: I would just like to speak to someone regarding accounting and financial assistance as it relates to the Clerk-Treasurer.  I currently use Keystone software for Budget.  It is also used for utility billing.  We use ADP for payroll - not by my choice.  I just want to see what else is out there and available and the cost associated with such as opposed to who the Town has used forever - so mum\'s the word that I\'m even contacting you.  I had another Clerk-Treasurer speak highly about her rep, so I thought I would reach out.  My number is (317) 485-4044 Ext. 104.  Thanks.\nRedirect: www.umbaugh.com/contact\n
