  My name is Ryan Eiteljorge and I recently graduated with my Bachelor\'s Degree in Accounting from Indiana State University.  I am currently seeking employment in the Indianapolis area (full time, internships, etc.) and wanted to provide my resume to your company for any considerations.  My current plans include completion of my Masters of Science Degree in Accounting followed by CPA testing.  Thank you and I will be looking forward to hearing from you in the future.
