This came about not so much because severance pay to individual staff members had been increased, but because of the fact that there was a large percentage of teachers nearing retirement age with no method for funding large payments that could come due in a given year.  As I understand it, the action by the General Assembly was to help schools who were being hurt by a ruling by the DLGF that pension debt could no longer be offset by tax levies in other funds.  This action was taken by the DLGF even though schools had issued pension bonds, with a long term amortization, and put in place the funding mechanisms, all at the encouragement of the State.  So this was another case of a state agency changing course for political reasons with little or no regard to the impact on school districts who had made long term financial commitments because they relied upon the advice of those same agencies in the past.
