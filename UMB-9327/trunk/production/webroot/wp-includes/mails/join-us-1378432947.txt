Form: join-us\nYour name: Brandon Booher\nYour email: bmbooher@iupui.edu\nYour phone number: 765-717-9962\nYour message: Dear Hiring Manager:


I recently discovered your Financial Analyst position on the Umbaugh website and would like to formally submit my application for the position.  This position emphasizes financial skills, teamwork, and communication skills.  It also requires individuals with strong problem-solving and analytical abilities.  I believe I would be a great fit for this position and this company.

This position stood out to me because of its communication and financially driven qualities.  I currently work as a salesperson at HHGregg and believe that my skill set from this position will transfer to Umbaugh tremendously.  I excel at sales and developing relationships with my current clients.  

Although I have not held a position in Finance before, I am about to graduate from Indiana University with a degree in Finance and believe that my education background will help me tremendously in this position.  I also excelled at key leadership projects while at Indiana University that will help me in this position.

Given my sales experience, education background, computer knowledge, and customer service experience, I believe I have the qualifications and experience that you are looking for.  Thank you for your consideration and taking the time to review my qualifications.  Please feel free to contact me by phone or email with any questions.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
