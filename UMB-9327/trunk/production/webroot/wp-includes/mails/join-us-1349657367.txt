Dear H.J. Umbaugh & Associates,
      
       I am interested in the financial analyst job opportunity that is offered in your company. As a finance major, I am drawn to a career in the financial analyst portion because of the business processes, organizational skills and extreme attention to detail that is used to help clients. I heard about this opportunity through MSUâ€™s mySpartanCareer database.
      I would be a perfect fit for the position because I prosper in team oriented environments as well as one on one interaction with fellow employees or clients. I recently finished an internship where I would collaborate with fellow teammates and analyze specific situations and how they would affect the company. We had the task of looking at the basic structure of the company and collaborate together to estimate certain costs and analyze potential projects to help the company develop and grow. This internship has allowed me to understand analytical financial solutions to the company and will be important in assisting H.J. Umbaugh and its cliental. 
      I have been involved in many different activities and organizations including the Michigan State University Finance Association, as well as career fair ambassador and special community ran events. The experience I have gained from these activities as well as rigorous coursework has taught me to manage my time while still performing in school, which will translate into great, effective performance at H.J. Umbaugh.
     Thank you for your time and attention. I am confident that my coursework as well as my internship and extracurricular activities at MSU will give me skills I need to be an avid contributor to your company. I look forward to hearing from you and scheduling an interview to further discuss the opportunity and my experience.

Sincerely,
Ryan Sparbeck
