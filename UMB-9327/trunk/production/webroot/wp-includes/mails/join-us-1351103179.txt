I am currently in my 5th year at Purdue University- West Lafayette. I\'m majoring in Accounting and Management and minoring in finance. When I graduate in May, I will have the required 150 credit hours for the CPA exam. I came across Umbaugh in my job search and it seems like a very enjoyable company to work for. I look forward to hearing from you in the future. \nRedirect: www.umbaugh.com/join-our-firm\n
