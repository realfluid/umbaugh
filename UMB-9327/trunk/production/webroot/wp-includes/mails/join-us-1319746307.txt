Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a finance/accounting professional with experience in manufacturing and investment industry. Today’s economy demands excellence in the areas of financial management and information systems. Accounting and finance professionals must not only monitor daily activities but also possess the vision to plan and implement strategic initiatives for the future wellbeing of the company that I am considered to be excellent at.
To enumerate a few of my achievements: 
•	I have consistently taken the initiative to reduce costs, plan and implement cross functional programs and work effectively with outside partners. 
•	Saved the company thousands of dollars that they paid in outside consulting to fix accounting errors.
•	Initiated a research after noticing that the bank with whom we maintained our biggest operating account failed in notifying us of a pertinent issue; which would result in our company paying huge penalty. I spearheaded the negotiations with the bank, accountability of the relationship management was held in question. After several rounds of discussion we switched our account over to a different bank who offered us better service and rates. Management applauded me for my close attention to detail.
•	My passion for knowledge, learning and growth helped me learn the new ERP system catered specifically for the manufacturing industry in a very short period of time.
•	 I learnt not only the ERP system but also the ABRA payroll software that the company implemented which ties directly to the ERP software.  
•	During an auditing of the company, my drive and initiative for learning, helped save the company 227,500 dollars in penalty from IDOR by researching and resolving a discrepancy of 3.25 million dollars between Federal and State sales tax filing.
•	 Impressed by that, the management moved me up to the Accounting Manager/Controller’s position.
•	 In that position, I streamlined the internal control procedure, helped save money through tax saving programs called IC-DISC especially designed for manufacturers of USA.
•	 Improved their financial and accounting procedure by resolving inaccuracies previously overlooked. 
This was just a synopsis of my overall experience and academic interest. Please find my resume enclosed for your consideration and review. Do not hesitate to contact me should you have any question. 

Thank you sincerely for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Jyoti Pandey
