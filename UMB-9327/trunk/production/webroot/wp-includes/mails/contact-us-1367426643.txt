I am looking for information regarding the financial statements for the Hammond Public Library Leasing Corporation. Syncora is the insurance provider on their Series 2005 bond issue, and we are in the process of a routine review. The current statements that have been filed are incomplete, and do not provide a debt footnote. Please let me know if there is somewhere I can locate this information, or if there is someone I can contact for that information.

Thank you,
