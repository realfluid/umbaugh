During and Internet search for employment opportunities within the Accounting/ Finance industries, I was directed to the website for Umbaugh and Associates. The purpose of this initial contact is to submit my resume for any open employment opportunities within the firm.

As my resume indicates, I have 5+ years in the Insurance industry, the entire time spent with a one company, CNO Financial Group (formerly Conseco Insurance Company).  In the Agent Care call center, I progressed from an Agent Care Advocate to a Lead Agent Care Representative, before moving into my current position as a Quality Assurance Analyst, overseeing the interactions of Agent Care representatives.  

Since working in the Insurance industry, I have developed a passion for “the business side” of companies.  This passion led me to pursue my Master’s in Business Administration, which I completed in August, 2011.  While specializing in Accounting, the curriculum also included courses such as Advanced Economics, Management and Advanced Strategic Marketing, among others. Along with my Accounting specialization, these courses helped to mold my “business mind,” leading me to search for employment opportunities where I can maximize my background and experience, while helping a company, or firm, achieve its goals and objectives.  

Here are just a few of the attributes that I will add to the firm:

* Knowledge of general accounting practices and procedures
* A strong customer service background
* Willingness to work independently and urgently to meet any deadline that is required
* Reliability and a desire to learn
* A strong work ethic and the ability to embrace challenging opportunities

I have attached my resume and contact information for your review.  I hope that we can meet and discuss how my abilities, professionalism and work ethic will add value to the company.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Ryan J. Hickey
