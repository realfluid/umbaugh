I am interested in a career with a successful company that has a prospective future ahead of them.  I would be interested in learning more about the company and about the possible job opportunities.

I have worked in county government full time for almost 13 years.  This has given me a variety of different experiences from door knocking and speeches to meetings and administrative duties.  I have attended many state called meetings, Road School, Commissioner and AIC conferences which has given me a great relationship among counties and companies.  I have a great personality, work great with people and I love a new challenge.

My resume, which is enclosed, contains additional information on my experience and skills.  I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss a future with your company and to provide further information on my candidacy.  I can be reached anytime via my cell phone, 765-720-7593.

Thank you for your time and consideration.  I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity.




Sincerely,
