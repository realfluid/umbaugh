Good Afternoon, My name is Lola Omotosho and I am currently a student at IPFW with Senior standing with an anticipated graduation date of June. 

I heard about the position of Financial Analyst/Entry level Accountant from a friend and would like to apply. I currently work at Navistar in Fort Wayne as a Financial/Track Typical Analyst and have served as an Intern with them for the past 2 years and I believe that I possess the necessary skills, experience and character that will be required for someone in that position.

I currently live in Fort Wayne and would be very interested and open to any further discussions about your company and future opportunities. Please feel free to contact me at 240-543-4449. I have also attached my resume for reference. 

Thank You for your consideration
