Dear Hiring Manager:

I recently reviewed your company website and saw that Umbaugh has an ongoing need for Staff Accountants and Accounting Interns.  I am very interested in an Accounting Intern position for the upcoming summer, and the combination of my skills and qualifications would make me an ideal candidate for the position.  

I am currently working towards a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a major in Accounting, as well as a Bachelor of Science in Informatics from Trine University (formerly Tri-State University).  I am set to graduate this coming May 2011.  Through my education, I have successfully completed seven courses in accounting, three courses in finance, and several other relevant courses, giving me a solid experience in both accounting and finance.  I have not held any previous accounting positions, but through my current position as a Resident Assistant and my past position as Staff Assistant to the Director of Student Life, I feel that I have excellent experience in customer relations as well as good organization and planning skills. 

As a Resident Assistant, I have to be organized and detailed, and often plan multiple events at once.  I have had to use good communication skills to help with conflict resolution, which has helped me learn and grow in complicated situations.  Through my Staff Assistant to the Director of Student Life position I have gained quality office experience through working closely with co-workers to plan activities, contacting and working with potential entertainment agencies, and attending weekly staff meetings.

My enclosed resume provides details of my related work experience and background information.  I can be reached by phone at (574) 209-0812 or through email at kryoder@my.trine.edu. I look forward to hearing from you.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,



Katelyn R. Yoder
