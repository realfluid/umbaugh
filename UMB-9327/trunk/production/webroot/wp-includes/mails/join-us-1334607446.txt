Form: join-us\nYour name: Fahad Nasir Siddiqi\nYour email: businessgraph@live.com\nYour phone number: (317) 701-1698\nYour message: Dear Recruiter:

My name is Fahad Nasir Siddiqi. I was going through some job listings and I came across the Staff Accountant position within your company. I was very excited hearing about this opportunity as one of the main focuses of this position is interacting with clients. As you can see on my resume, I have a lot experience dealing with customers and have done a great job maintaining long-term relationships with them. Because most of the business was done out of state (on national basis), trust was the biggest selling point, which our company was able to accomplish by offering Live Customer Support, and phone support. Apart from having one on one interactions, I have also been responsible for holding meetings with multiple clients at the same time.

Apart from this, I have also completed my education from IU Kelley School of business in the field of Accounting & Finance. I am in the process of taking my CPA examinations and will have it acquired by the end of 2012.

I think I will be a great fit and an asset for your organization as I have experience in multiple softwares such as Turbo Tax, Oracle e.t.c. that most of the clients use to keep their numbers in place.

I would love to have the opportunity to meet with you and learn more about the offered position. My resume is attached with this e-mail. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you for your time and consideration.


Sincerely,

Fahad Nasir Siddiqi.
