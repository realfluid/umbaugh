I am a municipal finance professional based in Chicago and actively looking for opportunities that include relocating out of state.  As an IU graduate, I have an extensive network of contacts in Indianapolis, and would easily be able to relocate there in a very short period of time.  Enclosed is my resume and I look forward to the opportunity to interview for this position.  

Sincerely,
Will Glass, CIPFA, MPA
