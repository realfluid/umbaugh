I am submitting my resume for your consideration for potential finance career opportunities.  The requirements for this role perfectly describe the type of environment I am seeking.  As an analytical thinker and constant researcher, I would be an excellent fit and provide tremendous value at Umbaugh.

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have sought every opportunity to grow and learn.  I am currently studying for the level II CFA exam, which I will be taking in June.  The knowledge gained from the CFA curriculum has been invaluable, both professionally and in my personal investment portfolio.  As a Senior Fund Accountant for Huntington Asset Services, I am responsible for training and supervising a team of fund accountants.  One of the most important duties is checking the financial reports for each fund daily to ensure all journal entries and transactions were input correctly.  Since July, I have reduced the number of accountancy errors by 12% while also developing efficiencies to improve both speed and accuracy.  In addition, I also work in coordination with our control group in researching corporate actions and their impact on the security.  These experiences, along with my skills in research and analysis, make me an ideal candidate at Umbaugh.

I have attached a copy of my resume for your review.  I am excited for the opportunity to contribute to the stellar work already being done at Umbaugh and look forward to hearing from you to discuss my qualifications in greater detail.

Sincerely,
