 My name is Indya White.  I saw on Umbaugh website that  the company  had open positions for Accounting and Finance interns and I want to submit my resume for consideration.  I consider myself to be a dedicated, hardworking and highly organized employee.  Many of my present and former supervisors and co-workers would agree also.  I am looking for an opportunity to further my career in the accounting field.
Currently I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Accounting and an Associate’s degree in Business Administration.  For the past five years, I have worked in accounts payable and payroll areas of accounting.  As an Accounts Payable Clerk, I was responsible for processing over 500 invoices per month. Primarily I focused on building vendor rapport, finding resolution with aging payable accounts and efficiency in billing for hotel stays. As a CrewPay Analyst, I was responsible for manually processing pay for over 1500 employees. This included differential pay, the up keep of each employee schedule and responding to contractual pay issues. 
I hope this email helps to provide some incite as to my previous background. I think your organization can provide me with the success I desire. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Best regards,
