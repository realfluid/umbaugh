I am interested in learning about hybridizing the two ADRs. I\'ve heard about med-arbs and arb-meds. Which is a better option? I am keen on writing an article on this. i also want to know which is better of the two? is India ready for such an amalgamation? \nRedirect: http://www.umbaugh.com/mediation-vs-arbitration\n
