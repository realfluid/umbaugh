Dear Sir/Madam:

I am writing to apply for a position in Accounting with your organization. 

I hold increased responsibilities with the New York State Department of Labor since I joined back in 2007 and am currently working as an Associate Accountant. My main responsibilities include but not limited to preparing funding applications, analyzing funding spending and supervising staff, etc.  Before the employment with the New York State, I was a Senior Accounting Analyst at The Ayco Company, a Goldman Sachs Company.  My responsibilities included preparing and analyzing financial statements, maintaining general ledges and cash flow as well as instructing and training new employees.  I earned my Masters degree in Accountancy from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, which has one of the best graduate programs in Accounting and Business in the United States. I am proficient at Microsoft Excel, word, access, People Soft etc.  

Due to family reasons I have to relocate to the Indianapolis area and am excited to learn about this opportunity.  I believe that my unique experience and education make me a qualified candidate for the position with your organization, and I have the confidence, maturity, and judgment to back up my qualifications. Please do not hesitate to contact me at the phone number above for more information. 

The enclosed resume provides additional information about my work experience and educational background.  I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss how I can contribute to your organization.


Sincerely,
