My name is Keith Spencer and I am currently a first year graduate student in the Masters of Public Administration at the University of Illinois at Springfield. Prior to graduate school while working in financial services I had the opportunity to learn more about  H. J. Umbaugh & Associates  and was incredibly  impressed with what I learned of the firm culture and your work with both large organization and within communities through the public finance division. I am interested in pursuing a summer internship position at your firm.

I have worked full-time in a range of areas in finance from private client to commercial real estate finance. Through these experiences working on transactions from origination through closing and performing detailed technical and economic analysis; I have gained a number of sales and communication skills and honed my analytic ability. 

Given my background in finance, sales, and analysis I am a particularly good fit for the summer internship position at your firm. I am impressed by your track record of working in every area of public finance from municipalities to non-profits developing creative financing and deal structures. I look forward to joining and contributing to your firm.

I would welcome an opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you and learn more about H. J. Umbaugh & Associates first hand at your convenience. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Keith Spencer
