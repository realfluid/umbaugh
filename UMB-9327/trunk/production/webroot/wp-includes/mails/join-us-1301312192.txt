Dear Umbaugh Recruiter,

I read with great interest about the finance career opportunities through Umbaugh’s career center.  Working in the challenging and dynamic finance industry has interest me as a young finance professional.  I graduated from Indiana University Bloomington with a degree in Public Finance Management from the School of Public and Environmental Affairs and a business foundations certificate from the Kelley School of Business.  I am extremely interested in learning more about the finance opportunities available with Umbaugh.

I finished my college career with a cumulative GPA of a 3.4 and major GPA of a 3.9.  I was nominated and served as a business technology peer tutor for students who needed assistance with Excel 2007.  With my dedication to academics, I was awarded the Dean’s List honor my last five semesters.  I possess strong analytical skills and enjoy challenges associated with finance.  In particular, for one of my class projects I completed a credit analysis of Atlanta, Georgia where I was responsible for collecting financial data, constructing graphs to illustrate fiscal conditions, assessing the economic conditions of the city, and ultimately making a decision on the credit worthiness of Atlanta.  A part from academics I have also been able to participate in countless philanthropic events through my fraternity such as Habitat for Humanity, Big Man on Campus, Tour de Cure, and Indiana University Dance Marathon.  One of the greatest accomplishments I have completed has been turning my passion of landscaping into a business from the experience I gained at Chapin Landscaping.  I am currently working at First Federal where I am performing financial transactions as well as interacting with customers on a daily basis.  I believe that my educational background as well as the business skills I have developed through past work experiences make me an ideal candidate.

Working at First Federal as a customer service representative has made me realize that I want to take on a more important role within the company, where I will be challenged, have the opportunity to impact business decisions, and will be intellectually stimulated.  I believe that a financial analyst/intern position would allow me the opportunity to make use of my organization abilities, time management capabilities, and finance background to positively advance the company.  I am very goal and detail oriented, which are attributes I believe are important in this position.  I enjoy projects associated with research and analysis; I received excellent grades in my cost benefit analysis and finance classes.  What sets me apart from other candidates is my proven track record of work experience.  I have proven that I am consistent and dependable once employed; I am a quick learner and willing to work hard to earn success.  I would truly enjoy the opportunity to work for a company that has a positive future like Umbaugh.

I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to review my resume as well as my cover letter. You may contact me at (317)-250-1854 (cell) or by email at mam13@indiana.edu if you have any further questions. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
