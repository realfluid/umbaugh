I hope this message finds you well. I am interested in opportunities with H. J. Umbaugh and Associates, Certified Public Accountants, LLP. after reading about one of your positions on the online jobs portal for the School of Public & Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. I am attaching a cover letter and copy of my resume in a single-PDF format (as requested) as a formal reflection of that interest.

Thanks for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you about future opportunities with Umbaugh. 

Sincerely,
