On Jan 1 2013 the newly created airport authority comes into existence and based upon my read of IC 8-22-3-33 it looks like the remainning money in December of 2012 becomes their money on 1January 2013.  If you can call me or email me back i can then confirm this result to the auditor and the council president.   thanks   robert monfort \nRedirect: http://www.umbaugh.com/partner/paige-e-sansone\n
