This e-mail is to express my interest in joining your firm as an intern from the 11/1/2013 to the 5/30/2014.
  
I just graduated from the Wiesbaden Business School in Germany with a bachelor’s degree in international business administration in the top 10% of all graduates in the last six semesters.  
Currently I am doing an internship in the accounting and finance department of Cordts Fleisch-Handel, an international meat trading company, to further expand my accounting and finance knowledge. In addition to that I am studying political science at the University of Hagen in the fourth semester. I expect to complete the course in 2014. 
When I worked as an intern for Miebach Consulting Inc. in Indianapolis last year I was able to become familiar with the American working culture, gain work experience in the consulting area and further develop my soft skills. My main consulting project during that time was the preparation of a request for proposal for logistical equipment and project specifications for Würth Canada during which I learned how to work more efficiently in a team and to keep an eye on details - no matter how unimportant they seem to be on the first look.
I am seeking to complement my academic knowledge with an internship at your firm in order to acquire the background necessary for a future career in the accounting industry and to gain more overseas experience.
Because of my diverse educational background, my international work experience and my strong soft and analytical skills in combination with my high motivation you will find me more than qualified for an internship and a valuable asset to your company.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Tim Cordts
