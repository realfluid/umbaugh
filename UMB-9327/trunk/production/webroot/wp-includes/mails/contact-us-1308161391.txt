          My name is Chris Lovelace.  I am a account executive with Comcast Business Class. .  I would like to set up a meeting to discuss your internet, phone and TV needs.  We have some great bundle packages that should save you some money.  I would like to met with you show you the benefits and savings Comcast can provide.  Please let me know a time that works for you.  If a meeting does not work I would like to get a quote out to you.  I look forward to hearing from you.  
Thanks and have a great day.
