I am a May 2011 graduate of the Indiana University Kelley School of Business with a Bachelors of Science degree in Finance.  I am particularly interested in pursuing an opportunity as a Financial Analyst within the Public Finance group at Umbaugh.  I believe my financial industry experience conducting analysis as well as my strong interest in public finance would make me a valuable contributor to your team.   

I first became interested in public finance during my last semester of college in 2011.  A friend whom I had known for many years through our swimming program asked me to write a letter to our local school board asking them reconsider their decision to close our school pool.  After conducting my own research of past budgets, I had found that many of the new budgetary projections seemed unfounded.   My initial reaction was confirmed when I reviewed the State Comptroller’s Audit of our school system which stated that the school board, “consistently overestimated expenditures and underestimated revenues, even though data was often available to develop more accurate budget estimates.”  This experience opened my eyes to the importance of finance professionals in the public arena and made me realize the tremendous contribution diligent financial advice can provide to the people who depend on public systems.      

Most recently I have been working at M&T Bank in the Commercial Lending division.  This opportunity has allowed me to gain insight into the applications of financial analysis and lending from a banking perspective.  In my current position I analyze the collateral profiles of new and existing obligations.  I then use that valuation to measure the bank’s exposure to risk based on different metrics outlined in loan contracts and internal credit approvals.  I also perform a due diligence function by utilizing various bank databases, loan documents, customer financial statements, and collateral pledge contracts, to assess discrepancies between the approved and actual terms of a loan.

Furthermore, my educational background has allowed me to develop an understanding of some fundamental concepts and skills which I believe would be relevant to the Financial Analyst position.  In college I comprehensively studied corporate finance, accounting, statistics, and economics. I also have completed coursework involving database design and statistical modeling techniques primarily using Microsoft Access and Excel.

I would truly appreciate the opportunity to expound upon my educational, occupational and experiential qualifications which are fully presented in my enclosed resume and demonstrating how I would be an ideal addition to your team.  Please feel free to contact me at any time by phone or e-mail if you have any questions regarding my candidacy.  Thank you.

 Sincerely,
