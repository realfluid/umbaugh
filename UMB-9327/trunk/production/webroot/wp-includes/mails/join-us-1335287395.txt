My name is Kinjal Patel.  I graduated from Kelley School of Business in May 2011 with a degree in Accounting and Finance.  I finished 150 credits upon graduation and am now in process of taking CPA exams to obtain my CPA license.  My work experience includes Patriot Products, where I do bookkeeping and other duties, H & R Block, where I prepared individual tax returns for clients, and PRN Associates, where I was a technician.  I am very interested in the position of Staff Accountant because it will give me the opportunity to learn a lot more and give me the opportunity to advance.  I have worked with the PeachTree and QuickBooks accounting software and have taken many accounting and finance classes in college as well as high school.  I am a team worker as well as individualist. I am dedicated to pay attention to every little detail.  I work hard with dedication, honesty, and sincerity and I can assure you that I would be an asset to the company.  Attached is my resume and I look forward to hearing from someone soon.  Thank you.
