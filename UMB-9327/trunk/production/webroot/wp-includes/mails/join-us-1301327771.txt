Hiring Manager
Indianapolis, IN

Dear Hiring Manager:

I am an ambitious and accomplished professional with extensive credit and risk management experience.  The enclosed resume outlines my background and experience, which parallels the Financial Analyst position with your company in Indianapolis, Indiana.

I have 18 years of experience in various roles managing credit and risk; currently as the Lead Analyst for a $150 million credit portfolio across Asia-Pacific.  While my current title is Global Credit Analyst, my responsibilities are more indicative of a Managerial role.  I have hands-on experience and leadership in domestic and international assignments focusing on domestic and international credit processes, risk analysis, policy and procedure development and implementation, and process improvement initiatives.  To illustrate:

	    I have trained teams in Dubai, India, Singapore, Africa and Australia about company credit policies and procedures and how to comply with those policies by modifying their work processes.

	    I manage a portfolio approaching $150 million with an average account size of approximately $1 million.

	    I have supported sales teams across multiple entities by proactively uncovering increased credit limit opportunities creating greater sales volume and profitability.

	    I have worked closely with CFOs and Credit Managers in multiple regions to analyze and reduce unutilized credit limits to eliminate unnecessary risk.

With demonstrated credit/risk management, client management, and leadership experience, I can lead and support credit and sales professionals to negotiate, manage and analyze business opportunities. I work effectively with client service and operations teams to resolve problems and deliver solutions that expand existing and develop new client relationships. 

Thank you for your consideration. Please contact me at (317) 840-7297.  I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,


Jason Lile
