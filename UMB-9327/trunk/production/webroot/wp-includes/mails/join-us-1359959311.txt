Form: join-us\nYour name: Fahad Nasir Siddiqi\nYour email: businessgraph@gmail.com\nYour phone number: 3177011698\nYour message: I am applying for your Staff Accountant position. I ran a business of my own for a few years after graduating. Even though I had great success and learned a great deal about business, I want to focus what I love, and that is working with numbers.

As a small business owner, I believe I can relate with many current and future clients of Umbaugh, This will help me connect with them and build a stronger relationship going forward.

I am testing for my CPA license as of now, and hope to have it acquired by the end of this year along with working for your company.

In the end, I would like to say that I love building relationships with clients and consider my peers part of family. If given an opportunity to meet someone for a personal interview, you/your team will find that I have nothing but passion for whatever I put my mind towards, and with the right guidance and training, I can be a valuable asset to the team.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to speaking with you.\nRedirect: www.umbaugh.com/join-our-firm\n
