Almost a month ago, I met with Cynthia Strzelecki from Spyglass Search concerning an CPA Analyst posting she did for your Plymouth office and I wanted to ensure that you had my resume on file.  After the meeting, I felt that this position would be a good fit due to my experience which includes over eight years of public accounting experience as well as three plus years as a controller.

Umbaugh looks like a great company that offers the best parts of public accounting by making a difference for your clients without the constant compliance work.  Also, it appears that there is plenty of room for professional growth and advancement.

Attached is my resume for your review, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Tony Gillisse\nRedirect: www.umbaugh.com/join-our-firm\n
