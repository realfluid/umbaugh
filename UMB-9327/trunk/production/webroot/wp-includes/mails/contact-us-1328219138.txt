I am a Junior at Indiana University Bloomington in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. I am a Management major, and I feel as though your company would be a great way to launch my future career in public affairs management, sales and marketing. I was wondering if your firm is hiring interns for this upcoming summer. If you have time, could you please respond with whether or not you are hiring summer interns?
