Form: join-us\nYour name: James Duncan\nYour email: jamesduncan2010@gmail.com\nYour phone number: 3175096795\nYour message: Hello, I am a recent graduate of the IUPUI’s School of Public and Environmental Affairs, writing to you to inquire about any public finance-related positions available at your firm. Umbaugh and Associates is well known for your work in public finance and I believe that I have something to offer. My Masters of Public Affairs brings with it a concentration in public policy analysis and experience as the 2011-2012 “Borst Fellow,” working under the senate fiscal staff. This combination of education and experience provides me with a broad exposure to the field as well as a core set of skills that I could apply to create value for your firm. 

Attached is a cover letter and resume that outline my past experiences and education. If I can be of any help in this process, please feel free to contact me. Thank you for your consideration. 

Best,

Jim Duncan
