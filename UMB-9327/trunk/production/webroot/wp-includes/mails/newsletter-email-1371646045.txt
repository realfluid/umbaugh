While I had a union representative, she did not highlight all what I was asking for. I feel betrayed and in the worst scenario, I feel that the harassment at work is going to continue because it was not addressed effectively. I want to withdraw my decision due to poor representation and coercion. Any suggestion and is this time bound to change my decision. In the meeting I asked whether I had to make a decision right away and I was informed that I had to.\nRedirect: http://www.umbaugh.com/mediation-vs-arbitration\n
