In looking at your website, I hoped we could partner up concerning the following:

Energy Smart Industry (ESI) can help your clients obtain tax credits (IRS section 1790 energy efficiency deduction); reduce utility costs, receive upfront cash advance on future savings with no cash out lays;  guaranteed. Please visit http://www.energysavingindustry.com. Then call Warren Pizik VP regional sales at 336-620-1273, so I can go into detail concerning this opportunity. In addition we pay referral fees for your assistance.

ESI can also save government agencies buy advancing some of their savings and reducing futures energy expenses. 

Thank you for consideration:
