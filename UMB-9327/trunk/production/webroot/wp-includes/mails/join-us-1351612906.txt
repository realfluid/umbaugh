Form: join-us\nYour name: Quinn Nicholson\nYour email: qtnicholson@gmail.com\nYour phone number: 317-417-3401\nYour message: My name is Quinn Nicholson and I am writing to request information regarding possible employment opportunities with H.J. Umbaugh & Associates. I received your contact information from your website after reading the Indianapolis Business Journal last week. I am confident that my skills are well aligned to fulfill an entry level staff accountant position, and that I would be an overall excellent fit for the organization as well.
 
As you will find with my attached resume, I have a wide range of experience which has helped me build up a strong skill-set, which I feel makes me a prime candidate for an entry-level associate position.  During my time at Purdue I was able to take a wide array of classes in accounting, management, and finance.  In my position as Logistics Analyst for Luxottica, I was able to significantly expand my skill-set. My responsibilities for weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports helped me to develop my time management skills and my interpersonal skills with upper levels of management in particular.   More recently, I have been able to strengthen my sales and social media marketing skills in my position with UpTempo Group.  I believe that these personal assets as well as my Bachelors Degree in both Accounting and Management, along with a minor in Finance, make me an excellent candidate for an entry level staff accountant position.  I am also actively pursuing my CPA and have completed Becker\'s Fast Pass course. 

I believe both my education and variety of experience make me an excellent fit for this opportunity. I have enclosed my resume for your consideration. Please feel free to contact me via phone or email at a time of your convenience to discuss my background as well as the requirements for the possible role. 

Best Regards,
