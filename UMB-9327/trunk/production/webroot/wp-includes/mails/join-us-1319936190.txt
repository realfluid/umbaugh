I feel that my skills, leadership qualifications, and personality traits will fit perfectly within the firm. I am looking forward to the opportunity to interview for the Finance Intern position at Umbaugh. Thanks!

Also, there is a misspelling in the Umbaugh application box. Word Document is spelled Docuent. Hope this helps!\nRedirect: www.umbaugh.com/join-our-firm\n
