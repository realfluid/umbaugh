I am assuming that the 63 you mention is not all of them -- you refer to it as a sample.

Incidentally, I was a player in the Indiana SW utility effort. As part of preparing a SW plan for Valparaiso in the 1980s, I suggested that they consider a utility concept. The then city engineer, John Hardwick, PE, who I suspect you know, got together with a legislator (Ayres?), drafted the \"law\", and got it passed.\nRedirect: http://www.umbaugh.com/utility-rate-reports-pt6\n
