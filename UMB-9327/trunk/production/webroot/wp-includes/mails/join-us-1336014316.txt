Thank you for taking the time to review my resume for a Staff Accountant position with Umbaugh.  As a professional, Iâ€™m eager to initiate a new career at an organization that will facilitate my growth and provide a future of advancement. I am focused on joining an innovative and successful firm. I trust Umbaugh is an ideal firm for my abilities.

Starting in January of 2002 through July of 2005 I spent my time focusing on utilizing my degree in Business Management. This gap gave me the opportunity to experience a career in sales, where I learned the importance of marketing. During this time, I studied Cost Accounting and Intermediate Accounting at IUPUI. After excelling in these courses, I decided to pass on a career in sales in order to make use of my accounting and finance strengths. 

Now I am a financial services professional who places a premium on integrity, loyalty and ethics. One of my strengths is being able to adapt at perfecting workflow processes and quality control. I am a forward-looker who is not afraid to think outside of the box for creative solutions.

Presently seeking the Staff Accountant position to take advantage of my analytical, leadership, and organizational skills, as well as the knowledge I have gained in accounting and finance coursework. My firm belief is that my aforementioned skills are an ideal fit for this position. I have the ability to excel in a team oriented or independent structure and I efficiently adapt to new material and unfamiliar computer software. My education, corporate AR, auditing, and analysis experience allows me to make an immediate and valuable impact on your organization. You can trust that I will put in the time and dedication needed to succeed.

Hopefully my resume will highlight some of my accomplishments, but I think it fails to represent my general enthusiasm for career advancement and my ability to work well with others. 

I look forward to meeting with you and learning more about the position, your objectives, and how I can contribute to the success of your organization. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
