My name is Monica Culver.  I would like to be considered for the position of Accounting Consultant.  I am a CPA with 20 years of diverse experience in mostly small, regional CPA firms desiring to apply my knowledge and experience to that position within your organization.  Although I may appear to be overqualified, I believe the experience and skills I can bring to the position will be advantageous to your company.

As evidenced by my resume my background includes all aspects of accounting from basic bookkeeping transactions to account analysis, adjusting journal entries and financial reporting.  I also have experience in maintenance of fixed assets as well as income, sales, personal property and payroll taxation.  Additionally, I have worked with numerous accounting, tax and fixed asset software packages and am easily adaptable to new ones.  My Word and Excel experience is at an intermediate level.
  
I look forward to hearing from you to further discuss my qualifications.  I may be reached on my cell phone at 765-346-0066 anytime or you may e-mail me at madmoeindy@sbcglobal.net.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Monica Culver
