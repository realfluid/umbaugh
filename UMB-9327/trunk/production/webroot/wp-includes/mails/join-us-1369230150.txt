I\'m not sure if someone with my background would be something you would be looking for as an employee, but I am curious.  I have a background in urban & regional planning and have done some work with private consultants & infrastructure projects in Madison County.  Please take a look at my resume and let me know if there is even a position at your firm (available or not) that my experience would fit.  I do not have any accounting background, so it is mainly out of curiosity since you work directly with cities, towns, counties, etc.   Thank you for your time.\nRedirect: www.umbaugh.com/join-our-firm\n
