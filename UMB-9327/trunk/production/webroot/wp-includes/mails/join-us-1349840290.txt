Form: join-us\nYour name: Matthew Parkinson\nYour email: mlparkinson@sbcglobal.net\nYour phone number: 317-439-1765\nYour message: Good evening,

Thank you for the opportunity to submit a resume and cover letter.  I have had an interest in Umbaugh\'s service offerings since first learning about the firm in 2008 while interning at the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance.  

As you can see in the attached resume and cover letter, I possess extensive experience working for and providing services to a variety of government organizations.  Knowing Umbaugh\'s strong reputation within the State, and having spent the last several years developing a solid foundation in government projects, I determined that the time is right to inquire about a career with your firm.

Please feel free to call me at 317-439-1765 or email me at mlparkinson@sbcglobal.net if you would like to discuss potential career opportunities at Umbaugh.  Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Best,
Matt Parkinson
