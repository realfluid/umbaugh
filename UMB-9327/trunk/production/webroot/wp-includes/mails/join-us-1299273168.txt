My name is Evan Davies and I am a first-year Masters\' of Public Affairs graduate student at Indiana University in Bloomington. I am writing to you as to inquire of any internship opportunities that might be available through your company. My finance advisor, Dr. John Mikesell, mentioned in his office hours that your firm has hired Public Affairs graduate students in the past and would be a good place to intern at this summer.

My core concentrations at SPEA are in economic development and public finance, with a particular interest in capital improvement financing at the state and local level. I have not only performed well in the classroom, but have also taken leadership position with student groups on Campus. I have attached my resume to this message in case you would like to have a look at my past professional experience.

I would sincerely appreciate it if you got back to me about any potential intern opportunities offered through UMBAUGH. I can be reached via email at davies.lowell@gmail.com or at my phone number 715- 562- 0278. 

Thank you for considering this request and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

Evan Davies
