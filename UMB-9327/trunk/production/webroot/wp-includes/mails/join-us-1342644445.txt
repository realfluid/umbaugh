As a recent college graduate with a degree in Finance, I am searching for a job that utilizes my newly acquired skills. There is no company that I would prefer to further develop my financial skills with than that of a large company known nationally for excellence.

Having attended college for finance, I have had the privilege to learn multiple aspects of businesses. Based on my experiences, I have corporate knowledge of dealing with multiple levels of management in order to get information and results. Having worked for a global manufacturing firm, I have gained valuable knowledge in the day-to-day operations of finance departments. Well pursuing my degree in finance, I had the pleasure to also take accounting classes that have better prepared me for all functions asked of a financial analyst. My recent experiences have given me the ability to better communicate with all departments on how to best reduce costs and improve profit. Being technologically savvy, I feel confident I can quickly and easily apply any new technology to create a leaner process. 

I look forward to the chance for an interview where my unique talents can best expand on what is in my attached resume. Please feel free to contact me with any additional questions that you may have.


Thank you for your consideration.


Sincerely,
