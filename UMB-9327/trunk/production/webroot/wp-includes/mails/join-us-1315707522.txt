Form: join-us\nYour name: Jordan Tasch\nYour email: jrtasch@umail.iu.edu\nYour phone number: (317) 439-1717\nYour message: I graduated in May from Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business with a degree in accounting and a 3.4 GPA.  After learning about Umbaugh through online research, and reviewing the available opportunities, I am very interested in pursuing an accounting position with your company.  My analytical skills, and my ability to work well with diverse groups of people make me a great fit for Umbaugh.

I am currently in my first year at Indiana University’s Maurer School of law, but this process has reinforced to me that my interests actually lie much more in accounting.  Because of this, I am planning on pursuing a career in accounting after this year of law school, rather than continuing on in the legal field.  The classes that I’m taking during this year of law school will allow me to reach the 150 credit hour requirement for the CPA exam, and I will be taking the CPA exam as soon as possible following this school year.

In addition to being a member of the Student Accounting Society at Indiana University, I gained valuable skills and experience through my accounting courses and team projects.  One of the projects in my Auditing & Assurance Services class involved performing an accounting analysis, business analysis, and risk assessment for a corporation.  These experiences strengthened my accounting and communication skills, and helped prepare me for future employment.

Due to the fact that I am currently a graduate student, I am no longer eligible to interview through Kelley’s Undergraduate Career Services Office.  I am very interested in Umbaugh, however, and I would enjoy the opportunity to interview with your company.  I can be reached at jrtasch@umail.iu.edu or (317) 439-1717.  Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
