I have experience working in federal and state government agencies, including under the CFO at the Indiana Commission for Higher Education. I also have a Master of Public Administration (MPA) from Indiana University, with concentrations in Public Financial Administration and Policy Analysis. I have a friend that works at Umbaugh and speaks very highly of the firm, so I wanted to inquire about positions at the Indianapolis office. Can you tell me if your firm is currently hiring and if so, are there any positions I might be qualified for? Thanks so much for your time.\nRedirect: www.umbaugh.com/contact\n
