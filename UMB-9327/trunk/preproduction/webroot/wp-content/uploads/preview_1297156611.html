        <p style="font: normal 12px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; margin: 1em 0;">By Belvia B. Hiadari, Manager, and Colette Irwin-Knott, Partner   &middot;   January 28, 2011</p>
        <p style="font: normal 12px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; margin: 1em 0;">The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act), signed into law by President Barack Obama December 17, 2010, did not extend many of the financing mechanisms and tools authorized by the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  Most of these provisions expired December 31. However, the Act does allow schools to issue Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZABs) in 2011.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Expiring Provisions</span></strong>

Build America Bonds (BABs) gave local governments the opportunity to issue taxable bonds with a direct payment interest expense subsidy of 35%. Approximately $180 billion in debt has been issued in BABs nationwide since April 2009.  Although the Act did not extend BABs, the program could be reauthorized in the future.

Financing mechanisms known as Qualified School Construction Bonds, Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds, and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds were not authorized beyond 2010; however, monies allocated in 2009 and 2010 for Qualified School Construction Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may still be issued in 2011.

Additionally, the limit for bank-qualified bonds will revert from $30 million to $10 million as it was prior to ARRA. Other expiring provisions include the alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption for private-activity bonds, and the ability for federal home loan banks to issue letters of credit for municipal bonds.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Allocation for Qualified Zone Academy Bonds</span></strong>

The Act allocates $400 million for QZABs for 2011, but we don't know yet what Michigan's share of the allocation will be.  Monies allocated in 2011 may be issued only as tax credit bonds (credits are provided to the purchaser).  Monies that were allocated in 2009 and 2010 still have the direct pay option (interest expense subsidy is provided to the issuer) even if the bonds are issued in 2011.
